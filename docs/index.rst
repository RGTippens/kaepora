kaepora
=======

*kaepora* is an open-source relational database of Type Ia Supernova observations. This guide is meant to outline how to install and interact with the database. We also provide tools for creating composite spectra using the methods from `Siebert et al. 2019 <https://msiebert1.github.io/publication/2019-XX-XX-Siebert_2019_MNRAS>`_.
